An interactive web application designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the inner workings of the A5/1 stream cipher, commonly used in GSM mobile phone communications. This tool provides a step-by-step visual representation of the cipher's key setup, clocking mechanism, and keystream generation process.

## Features

*   **LFSR Initialization:** Visualize the loading of the 64-bit session key and 22-bit frame number into the three Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs).
*   **Dummy Clocks:** Observe the 100 "dummy" clocking cycles that mix the register states after initialization.
*   **Majority Clocking:** Clearly see which LFSRs are clocked in each step based on the majority rule applied to their designated clocking bits.
*   **Keystream Generation:** Watch as individual keystream bits are generated by XORing the output bits of the three LFSRs.
*   **Encryption/Decryption:** See the plaintext being XORed with the generated keystream to produce ciphertext, and vice-versa for decryption.
*   **Step-by-Step Execution:** Control the process one bit at a time to closely follow the algorithm.
*   **Run All:** Generate the full keystream and encrypt/decrypt the entire message at once.
*   **Detailed Log:** A comprehensive log provides textual explanations of each step and calculation, reinforcing understanding.
*   **Visual LFSRs:** Each LFSR's state is displayed, with tap, clocking, and output bits highlighted.
*   **Responsive UI:** Basic responsiveness for usability on different screen sizes.

## How A5/1 Works (Simplified Overview)

The A5/1 cipher consists of three LFSRs of different lengths:
*   **R1 (X):** 19 bits
*   **R2 (Y):** 22 bits
*   **R3 (Z):** 23 bits

**Initialization:**
1.  All registers are initially zeroed.
2.  The 64-bit session key is mixed in by clocking all three registers 64 times, XORing each key bit with the feedback bit of each LFSR.
3.  The 22-bit frame number is mixed in similarly, clocking all registers 22 times.
4.  The registers are then clocked 100 times using the majority clocking rule (see below), but the output is discarded. This is to further diffuse the key and frame number.

**Keystream Generation:**
For each bit of keystream required:
1.  **Majority Vote:** Examine specific "clocking bits" from each LFSR (bit 8 of R1, bit 10 of R2, bit 10 of R3).
2.  **Clocking:** Determine the majority value (0 or 1) of these three clocking bits. Only those LFSRs whose clocking bit matches the majority value are clocked in this cycle.
3.  **Output:** The last bit (Most Significant Bit after shifting in A5/1's typical representation, or the bit specified as output in this visualizer's configuration) of each of the three LFSRs is XORed together.
4.  The result of this XOR operation is the keystream bit.

**Encryption/Decryption:**
*   **Encryption:** Plaintext bit XOR Keystream bit = Ciphertext bit
*   **Decryption:** Ciphertext bit XOR Keystream bit = Plaintext bit

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** Styling and visual presentation.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic of the A5/1 cipher simulation and UI interactivity.

## Usage

1.  **Open the Visualizer:** Navigate to the live demo URL.
2.  **Inputs:**
    *   **64-bit Key (binary):** Enter or use the default 64-bit binary session key.
    *   **22-bit Frame No. (binary):** Enter or use the default 22-bit binary frame number.
    *   **Plaintext (ASCII):** Enter the ASCII plaintext message you want to encrypt.
3.  **Controls:**
    *   **Initialize LFSRs:** Click this first to load the key and frame number and perform the initial dummy clocks. The LFSR states will update.
    *   **Next Keystream Bit:** After initialization, click this to generate one bit of keystream, encrypt/decrypt the corresponding plaintext/ciphertext bit, and see the LFSRs clock according to the majority rule. Observe the log for details.
    *   **Generate Full Keystream & Encrypt/Decrypt:** After initialization, click this to automatically process the entire plaintext message.
    *   **Reset All:** Resets the visualizer to its initial state with default inputs.
4.  **Observe:**
    *   **LFSR States:** Watch the bits shift and change. Pay attention to the highlighted tap, clock, and output bits.
    *   **Clocking Decision:** See which LFSRs are clocked and why.
    *   **Keystream & Output:** Track the generated keystream and the resulting ciphertext.
    *   **Log:** Read the step-by-step explanations.
